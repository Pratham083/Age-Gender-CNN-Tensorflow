# Age and Gender CNN using Tensorflow

This project contains two notebooks I coded to create convolutional neural networks (CNN), one that predicts the age of a person, and the other that predicts the gender. The age CNN takes in a 200x200x3 pixel image (RGB), and the gender CNN takes in a 128x128x3 pixel image (RGB).

The age prediction model had a mean absolute error of 5.00 years (on validation data of 3k images), and the gender prediction model had an accuracy of 95.32% (on validation data of 14k images).

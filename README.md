# Age and Gender CNN using Tensorflow

This project contains two notebooks I coded to create convolutional neural networks (CNN), one that predicts the age of a person, and the other that predicts the gender. The age CNN takes in a 200x200x3 pixel image (RGB), and the gender CNN takes in a 128x128x3 pixel image (RGB).

The age prediction model had a mean absolute error of 5.00 years (on validation data of 3k images), and the gender prediction model had an accuracy of 95.32% (on validation data of 14k images).

## Try the Models Yourself

If you have an android device and want to test out these models, you can download my app on the playstore here.

## My Process of Improving the Models

## Potential Improvements

## Installation/Usage Instructions

If you want to run my code, you will need the neccessary modules, as well as training/testing data.

### Data

The data I used to train the age CNN is a combination of UTKface and blank.

The data I used to train the gender CNN is a combination of UTKface and blank.

### Modules

Paste the packages in my environment.
